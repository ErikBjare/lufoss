LUFOSS Guidelines
=================

Lund University Fund for Open Source Software (LUFOSS) gives scholarships to persons that contribute to Open Source Projects (OSS) projects with significant utility and impact. Nominees can be students, doctoral candidates, and software developers in their early careers. This document describes the guidelines of LUFOSS that are used to assess nominees and encourage open source activities. These guidelines are based on the [LOFOSS Scholarship Criteria](https://github.com/bjornregnell/lufoss/#criteria). 

## Scholarship Categories

The LUFOSS scholarships are currently given in these categories:

* Student at BSc and MSc level
* Newly Graduated Student
* Doctoral Candidate

In the future we may add more categories to the list, for example awards to OSS projects and communities.

## Assessing nominated developers

The activities of a nominated persons are assessed along three maturity dimensions: Creating, Giving and Receiving contributions. Contributions can be code, test cases, documentation, reviewing, testing, and other activities that are relevant to open source software development.

  * **Creating** contributions. You are creating your own original open source software.  
    * Level 0: Initial. You are not yet developing open source.
    * Level 1: Beginning. You have a registered user identity at a site of an [open source software community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_software_packages) or at a public [code hosting service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source_code_software_hosting_facilities), such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
    * Level 2: Maturing. You have created and maintain at least one original software repository with an explicit [open source licence](http://opensource.org/licenses).
    * Level 3: Significant. You have created several original repos, of which at least one has shown to be valuable to other developers an/or engaged users. Evidence of impact and indication of potential utility of your software contributions can be shown, e.g., by forks, user feedback forums, active issue reporting, etc.
    
  * **Giving** contributions to others.
    * Level 0: Initial. You have not yet contributed to other projects, outside of your own repos.  
    * Level 1: Beginning. You have made your first contribution to another open source software project that was not started by yourself. 
    * Level 2: Maturing. You have made several contributions to other open source software project that was not started by yourself.
    * Level 3: Significant. You have made significant impact over a longer period to at least one open source software project that was not started by yourself.
  
  * **Receiving** contributions from others.
    * Level 0: Initial. You have not yet received any contributions from others to any repo that you host or maintain.
    * Level 1: Beginning. You have received at least one contribution from others to any repo that you host or maintain.
    * Level 2: Maturing.
    * Level 3: Significant.
    
A *Maturity Index* for a person is calculated by a simple sum of the level numbers of the above three dimensions.

## Assessing software repos

Open source software repositories are assessed along these levels:

    * Level 0: Initial. The repo does not yet have an explicit [open source licence](http://opensource.org/licenses).
    * Level 1: Beginning. The repo has an explicit [open source licence](http://opensource.org/licenses) and has some explicitly stated (potential) utility. The repo is available publicly for download by anyone.
    * Level 2: Maturing. The repo has good README including purpose, easy download, install and build instructions and sufficient documentation on how to use the software. It is explicitly described how to make contributions to the repo. 
    * Level 3: Significant. The repo has an active and engaged user base and is maintained with explicit contribution policies, while receiving contributions from a set of actively involved contributors. The repo has an explicit governance model and actively encourages contributions. Pull-requests are merged after reveiws and/or testing.
