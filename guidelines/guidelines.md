LUFOSS Guidelines
=================

Lund University Fund for Open Source Software (LUFOSS) gives scholarships to persons that contribute to Open Source Projects (OSS) projects with significant utility and impact. Nominees can be students, doctoral candidates, and software developers in their early careers. This document describes the guidelines of LUFOSS that are used to assess nominees and encourage open source activities. These guidelines are based on the [LOFOSS Scholarship Criteria](https://github.com/bjornregnell/lufoss/#criteria). 

## Mission

  * **Level 2**: *Contributing*. In addition to Level 1, the nominee has contributed outside his/her own repos to at least one OSS repos maintained by other developers. 
  * **Level 3**: *Merging*. In addition to Level 2, the nominee's own repos has at least a couple of contributions (merged pull-requests) by another developer.
